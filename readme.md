 The complexity is dazzling, wow WOW

Click on VCS, enable ( for the whole project )-> turn red bc u are not tracing them
After you click on add to git to keep track of the files you decide.

To create a repository in github

1) Create files .py & .md
2) Enable VCS for whole project -> git
3) Files should turn red
4) After add the files you want to track individually (to git)
5) Import into Version Control and share on Github

To pull changes made on github

1) VCS, git, pull

To push changes into github

1) save & commit file
2) vcs, git, push

Truth value testing: all objects can be tested for truth value
                       by default all objects are considered true
                       unless: .Specifically false
                                None
                                0
                                0.0
                                empty sequence/collection: "", [], ()

or -> if x is false, then y, else x         :: 0 or 7 = 7, 5 or 7 = 5
and -> if x is false, then x, else y        :: 5 and 7 = 7, 0 or 7 = 0
not -> if x is false, then True, else False :: not 7 = false (always boolean)

Comparison operators:
<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, is (object identity), is not

is: a=5, b=5, a is b = True

Bitwise operators (only for integers):
 101 | 110 = 111
 5 | 6 = 7
 101 & 110 = 100
 5 & 6 = 4

print returns the none type
3|2.0 error

3 > (0**0 * 4) = False

2 > 1 and 5 = 5


True behaves like 1

### Getting input

Use function input
input([prompt]) -> prompt is an optional arg that will be printed before asking for input

use int() float() to convert
int(2.4) = 2

(there is a way to try and catch)
